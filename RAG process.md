## RAG Process: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

1. **Create LLM Object**: Set up a pre-trained **Large Language Model** (e.g., **Gemini** or **GPT**) that will generate responses.

2. **Create Prompt Template**: Design a dynamic prompt template with placeholders for context and the userâ€™s query, which guides the LLM in generating the correct response.

3. **Get Embeddings Generator**: Use an embeddings model (e.g., **Google** or **OpenAI**) to convert text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

4. **Load Document**: Load the document(s) to be processed (e.g., PDFs, text files).

5. **Create Chunks Using Splitter**: Split the document into smaller chunks with a defined **chunk size** and **overlap** to ensure manageable and contextually relevant pieces.

6. **Create Vector DB**: Store the embeddings of the chunks in a **vector database** (e.g., **FAISS**), enabling efficient retrieval based on similarity.

7. **Get Prompt**: Prepare the input prompt (user query) that will guide the LLM to process the retrieved context.

8. **Create Chain with LLM and Prompt**: Set up a **document chain** where the LLM and prompt template interact to generate answers based on the retrieved context.

9. **Create Retriever from Vector DB**: Create a **retriever** that searches the vector database for the most relevant chunks based on the query's embedding.

10. **Create Retrieval Chain**: Combine the **retriever** and **document chain** into a **retrieval chain**. This chain first retrieves relevant documents based on the query and then passes them to the LLM to generate a response.

11. **Generate Response**: The retrieval chain processes the query by fetching relevant context and generating the final answer using the LLM.
